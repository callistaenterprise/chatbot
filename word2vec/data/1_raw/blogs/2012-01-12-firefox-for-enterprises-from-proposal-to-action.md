According to the Mozilla Blog, Firefox is about to be released in an enterprise version, with releases once every year instead of once every 6:th week.

The new version of the Firefox is called Firefox Extended Support Release or simply Firefox ESR. The intention is to provide security updates continously but let the web and add-ons platform be stable throughout the 1 year release.

I have experience from developing and maintaining both web frameworks and web applications at big companies and  have noticed that Firefox's recent 6 weeks release  cycle have created problems for developers keeping up with certifying the quality of their software with the latest browser release. Firefox ESR might be a welcome change for framework and application developer's in enterprises since it, in my humble opinion, might ease the the task of choosing Firefox as a tactical appointed enterprise platform for internal web-applications.
