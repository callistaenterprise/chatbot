A major challenge in a distributed system (e.g. a system landscape of microservices) is to understand what is going on and even more importantly â€“ what is going wrong, where and why. In this blog post we will see how we can use the **ELK** stack (i.e. [**E**lasticsearch][Elasticsearch], [**L**ogstash][Logstash] and [**K**ibana][Kibana], ) from [Elastic] to aggregate log events from our microservices in the [blog series - Building Microservices](/blogg/teknik/2015/05/20/blog-series-building-microservices) into a centralized database for analysis and visualization.

# 1. Introduction

Let's start with a short description of the new components and some new challenges!

## 1.1 The ELK stack

The ELK stack from [Elastic] consist of:

* **[Logstash]**  
Logstash can collect log events from multiple types of sources using  [*input*][logstash-input] plug-ins, transform it to a format you prefer using [*filter*][logstash-filter] and [*codec*][logstash-codec] plug-ins and send it to a number of destinations using [*output*][logstash-output] plug-ins.

* **[Elasticsearch]**  
Elasticsearch is a distributed and scalable full-text search database, that allows you to store and search large volumes of log events.

* **[Kibana]**  
Kibana lets you visualize and analyze your log events stored in Elasticsearch.

Elastic provides official Docker images for [Logstash][logstash-docker], [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch-docker] and [Kibana][kibana-docker].

## 1.2 Collecting log events in a containerized world

Collecting log events in a container world is not the same as before when we were used to collect log events by [tailing][tail] log files. That does not work in a containerized world where a container's file system is ephemeral by default, i.e. it is destroyed if the container crashes. So, for example, after a restart there will be no log file to read log events from to understand what caused the restart. Instead we need to handle log events from containers as an event stream. For more information on the subject see [the twelve factor app - treat logs as event streams][12-factor-log-stream].

## 1.3 Docker Log Drivers

In [Docker v1.6.0](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#160-2015-04-07) (released 2015-04-07) a logging mechanisms called *Log Drivers* was introduced to handle log events as a stream. A number of formats are today supported out of the box, see [supported logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/#supported-logging-drivers).

## 1.4 Selecting a log driver 

When selecting a log driver, we have to match the supported log drivers from Docker with the supported input plugins from Logstash. Both Gelf and Syslog formats are supported by Docker and Logstash. [Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) is an old and restricted standard for log events, something that the newer Gelf format aims to overcome. See [Gelf docs](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.3/pages/gelf.html) for further explanations. Gelf is clearly preferred over Syslog. When using the Gelf format, Logstash does unfortunately not support (from my understanding) multiline log events, e.g. log events with stack traces. For details see discussions [here][logstash-gelf-muliline-issue-1] and [here][logstash-gelf-muliline-issue-2]. Therefore, we will use the old Syslog format in this blog post.

# 2. Code walkthrough

There are two source code files of interest for enabling the ELK stack:

1. The **Docker Compose file**, where we bring in the ELK stack plus configure use of the selected Docker Log Driver, i.e. Syslog, for each microservice
2. The **Logstash configuration file**, where we specify and configure what *input*, *codec*, *filter* and *output* elements we want to use.

The source code contains two Docker Compose files:

1. One with the ELK stack, `docker-compose-with-elk.yml`, 
2. One without the ELK stack, `docker-compose-without-elk.yml`   
(i.e. same compose file as in the previous blog post, but with a new name).

The shell script `setup-env.sh` is used to control which Docker Compose file that is in use by setting up the environment variable `COMPOSE_FILE`:

	export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-with-elk.yml
	#export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-without-elk.yml

## 2.1 Docker Compose configuration

The most interesting new parts of the compose file `docker-compose-with-elk.yml` are the following:

### 2.1.1 Bring in the ELK stack

Adding the ELK stack can, as mentioned above, be done by using official Docker images from Elastic like:

	  elasticsearch:
	    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.2.2
	    ports:
	      - "9200:9200"
	    environment:
	      - "xpack.security.enabled=false"
	      - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
		
	  kibana:
	    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:5.2.2
	    ports:
	      - "5601:5601"
	    environment:
	      - "xpack.security.enabled=false"
		
	  logstash:
	    image: docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:5.2.2
	    ports:
	      - "25826:25826"
	    volumes:
	      - $PWD/elk-config:/elk-config
	    command: logstash -f /elk-config/logstash.config

> **Note #1:** The Docker images comes with a commercial, non free, extension called [X-Pack]. X-Pack bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one package. X-Pack includes a trial license for 30 days. To avoid dependencies to non-free extensions of the ELK stack we have disabled the X-Pack by setting the environment variable `xpack.security.enabled` to `false` for Elasticsearch and Kibana.
> 
> **Note #2:** To reduce the memory used for our test purposes, we have limited the memory usage for Elasticsearch by setting the environment variable `ES_JAVA_OPTS` to `-Xms512m -Xmx512m`.

### 2.1.2 Startup dependencies

To be able to capture log events from the startup of our microservices it is important that they don't start before Logstash is ready to receive log events. In the same way Elasticsearch needs to be up and running before Logstash can start to send log events to Elasticsearch.

> **Note:** In a production environment, we are probably using a container orchestrator like Docker in Swarm mode or Kubernetes. Using a container orchestrator, we can set up Logstash and Elasticsearch as services that, at least conceptually, always are up. 

During development, we want to use Docker Compose to start up all containers (both for the ELK Stack and our own microservices) with one command. This leads to that we need to instruct Docker Compose to not start depending containers until the containers they depend on are started and ready to receive requests.

To achieve this we can use:

1. `healthcheck` - instructions, to tell Docker runtime how to monitor a container and ensure that it is ok and ready to receive requests.
2. `depends_on` - instructions, to tell Docker to not start a container until the container it depends on is started. By also specifying the condition `service_healthy` we ask Docker runtime to wait to start the container until the container it depends on not only is started but also reports that it is healthy (through its health check described above).

For the Elasticsearch container we have specified the following health check:

	  elasticsearch:
	    ...
	    healthcheck:
	      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9200"]
	      interval: 10s
	      timeout: 5s
	      retries: 10

For Kibana and Logstash we have added a dependency to the Elasticsearch container (to ensure that they are not started until Elasticsearch is ready):

	  kibana:
	    ...
	    depends_on:
	      elasticsearch:
	        condition: service_healthy
	
	  logstash:
	    ...
	    depends_on:
	      elasticsearch:
	        condition: service_healthy

For Logstash we have also specified a health check:

	  logstash:
	    ...
	    healthcheck:
	      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080"]
	      interval: 10s
	      timeout: 5s
	      retries: 10

All microservices that wants to send log events to Logstash defines a dependency to Logstash like:

	  pro:
	    depends_on:
	      logstash:
	        condition: service_healthy

### 2.1.3 Configure the Syslog log driver

As described above we have decided to use the Syslog driver.

To configure a container to send its log events using Syslog in Docker you can specify something like the following in the Docker Compose file:

    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        syslog-address: "tcp://host:port"

Since we gave the Logstash container the name `logstash` and published the port `25826` you might think that the `syslog-address` should be set to: `"tcp://logstash:25826"`, but that does not work :-(

The reason for this is that the the Syslog driver is running in the Docker daemon and the Docker daemon can't access our application's specific network where the hostname `logstash` is defined. Instead we can use port-mapping, i.e. expose the Syslog port in the Logstash container in the Docker host. This means that the Docker daemon can address the Logstash Syslog port using the local IP address `127.0.0.1`.

So, the configuration looks like this:

    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        syslog-address: "tcp://127.0.0.1:25826"

For further details see the following [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20370#issuecomment-185229591).

## 2.2 Logstash configuration

Let's go through the *input*, *codec*, *filter* and *output* elements in the Logstash configuration file. The source code can be found at `elk-config/logstash.config`. 

1. **`Input` and `codec`**

		input {
		
		  http {
		    port => 8080
		    type => "healthcheck"
		  }
		
		  syslog {
		    type => syslog
		    port => 25826
		
		    codec => multiline {
		      pattern => "^<%{POSINT}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP} %{SYSLOGHOST}\[%{POSINT}\]: %{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601}"
		      negate => true
		      what => previous
		    }
		  }
		
		}

	We accept input from `http` for the health check declared for Logstash in the Docker Compose file (see Â§2.1.2 Startup dependencies) and from `syslog` for the log events. We apply a multiline codec for the log events. The multiline codec is setup to find log events that does not start with a timestamp and consider them as a part of the previous log event. This means that all lines in a stack trace are merged into the log event for the actual error. For details see the [Reference Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-multiline.html).
		
1. **`Filter`**

			filter {
			
			  if [type] == "healthcheck" {
			    drop {}
			  }
			
			  mutate {
			    strip => "message"
			  }
			
			  grok {
			    match => {
			      "message" => "<%{POSINT:syslog_pri}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname}\[%{POSINT:syslog_pid}\]: %{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:ml_date}(%{SPACE})? %{LOGLEVEL:ml_level} \[%{DATA:ml_service},%{DATA:ml_traceId},%{DATA:ml_spanId},%{DATA:ml_zipkin}\] %{INT} --- \[%{DATA:ml_thread}\] %{DATA:ml_classname} : %{GREEDYDATA:ml_message}"
			    }
			  }
			
			  if "multiline" in [tags] {
			    mutate {
			        gsub => [ "message", "<\d+>.*?:\s", ""]
			    }
			  }
			
			  mutate {
			    strip => "ml_thread"
			    remove_field => [ "level", "version", "command", "created", "message", "tag", "image_id", "severity", "priority", "facility", "severity_label", "facility_label", "syslog_pri"]
			  }
			
			}
		

	The filter processing does the following:
	
	1. First, we start with dropping any input from the `http` input, i.e. health checks.
	1. Next, we remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the message field to make it easier to parse. 
	1. Using a [Grok filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html) we extract and name the parts we are interested in from the log event. Fields in the log event created by syslog are prefixed with `syslog_` and fields coming from our microservices are prefixed with `ml_`. 

		> **Note:** If you find it hard to get your Grok patterns set up correctly I suggest you try out the [Grok debugger](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com)!

		We collect the following `syslog` fields (see [RFC 3164](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt) for details):

		1. `syslog_pri`: the `PRI` part of a syslog message
		1. `syslog_timestamp`: the `TIMESTAMP` part of a syslog message
		1. `syslog_hostname`: the `HOSTNAME` part of a syslog message
		1. `syslog_pid`: the `PID` part of a syslog message

		We collect the following fields from the Java logging framework, [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch):
		
		1. `ml_date`: timestamp
		1. `ml_level`: log level
		1. `ml_thread`: thread id
		1. `ml_classname`: name of the logging Java class
		1. `ml_message`: the actual message in the log event

		We also collect the following trace information from Spring Cloud Sleuth (see the [previous blog post](/blogg/teknik/2017/07/29/building-microservices-part-7-distributed-tracing/#51-trace-information-injected-in-log-events-by-spring-cloud-sleuth) for details):

		1. `ml_service`: name of the microservice
		1. `ml_traceId`: the trace id 
		1. `ml_spanId`: the span id
		1. `ml_zipkin`: boolean indicating if the span was reported to Zipkin or not 

	1. If the log event is a multiline event we have to strip of some leading text on each line added by syslog, e.g.: `<30>Sep  9 06:32:08 89f30c64f36a[1966]: `
	1. Finally, we get rid of some fields in the log event that we don't want to store in Elasticsearch.

	
1. **`Output`**

		output {
		  elasticsearch {
		      hosts => "elasticsearch"
		      ssl => "false"
		      user => "logstash_system"
		      password => "changeme"
		    }
		  stdout {
		    codec => rubydebug
		  }
		}

	Log events are sent to:
	
	1. `elasticsearch` for storage, to be picked up by Kibana
	2. `stdout` for debugging purposes, using the `docker compose logs` command
	
# 3. Build and Run

For details on how to build and run the microservice landscape in this blog post series, see the [blog post #5].

> **Note #1:** To be able to run some of the commands used below you need to have the tools [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed.
> 
> **Note #2:** Since *blog post #5* this blog series is based on [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) and no longer [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) and [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), that was used in earlier blog posts. If you have Docker Machine installed be sure to run the following command to direct your Docker client tools to work with Docker for Mac:
> 
> 		$ eval $(docker-machine env -u)

In summary:

1. Open a terminal, create a folder of your choice and `cd` into it:

		$ mkdir a-folder-of-your-choice
		$ cd a-folder-of-your-choice

1. Since we have externalized our configuration into a configuration repository we first need to get it from GitHub:

		$ git clone https://github.com/callistaenterprise/blog-microservices-config.git

1. Next, we get the source code from GitHub and checkout the branch used for this blog post:

		$ git clone https://github.com/callistaenterprise/blog-microservices.git
		$ cd blog-microservices
		$ git checkout -b B11 M11

1. Now, we can build our microservices with:

		$ ./build-all.sh

1. Finally, we can bring up the dockerized microservice landscape and run a test:

		$ . ./test-all.sh start

	> **Note #1:** We will not shut down the microservice landscape (can be done by adding the parameter: `stop`), since we will use it in the next section.

	> **Note #2:** The first `.` in the command above is essential. It allows us to reuse the `TOKEN` environment variable that the script creates to store an OAuth Access Token, i.e. we don't need to acquire one ourselves.

	After a while, the processing should end with the response from a API request like:
	
		$ curl -ks https://localhost:443/api/product/123 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .
		{
		  "productId": 123,
		  "name": "name",
		  "weight": 123,
		  "recommendations": [	...  ],
		  "reviews": [ ... ],
		  "serviceAddresses": { ... }
		}
		End: Sun Sep 1 13:33:25 CEST 2017	

1. Try a manual call like:
	
		$ curl -ks https://localhost/api/product/456 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .


# 4. Try out centralized logging with the ELK stack

## 4.1. Verify and configure the ELK stack

1. First verify that Elasticsearch is up and running:

		$ curl http://localhost:9200 | jq .
		{
		  "name" : "hK0W3cd",
		  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
		  "cluster_uuid" : "KauuQNszTXKOoOdhwgZK6Q",
		  "version" : {
		    "number" : "5.2.2",
		    "build_hash" : "f9d9b74",
		    "build_date" : "2017-02-24T17:26:45.835Z",
		    "build_snapshot" : false,
		    "lucene_version" : "6.4.1"
		  },
		  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
		}

1. Next verify that we have some indices in Elasticsearch containing data from Logstash:

		$ curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
		health status index                             uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
		yellow open   logstash-2017.09.01               Sv3K6CEyQ2GEl6HtjU3zKQ   5   1        544            3      1.2mb          1.2mb
		yellow open   .monitoring-kibana-2-2017.09.01   -WfBYJJETTm2qRshojGHBw   1   1         30            0     46.7kb         46.7kb
		yellow open   .kibana                           tjoLGboOQxOIpsXPQAiV6g   1   1          1            0      3.1kb          3.1kb
		yellow open   .monitoring-logstash-2-2017.09.01 NZVw7B7aRjGh4_Pk1Q_hGw   1   1         30            0       51kb           51kb
		yellow open   .monitoring-es-2-2017.09.01       x7JK10GNRwSqJyq63-Padw   1   1        440            0    709.7kb        709.7kb
		yellow open   .monitoring-data-2                75Uv2spMTGiz_-qzjfx3dg   1   1          4            0      9.7kb          9.7kb


1. Finally, we need to configure Kibana a bit:

	1. Open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) i your web browser. You should see something like:

		![kibana-1](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-1.png)

	1. Accept the default values for what index to use and click on the Create button.

		![kibana-2](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-2.png)

	1. Kibana will now display the fields in the Logstash index. Click on the "_Discover_" tab in the blue menu to the left.

		![kibana-3](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-3.png)
	
	1. Kibana will now show log events. Select and add the following fields: `ml_level`, `ml_service`, `ml_traceId`, `ml_message` and `syslog_hostname`.

		![kibana-4](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-4.png)
	
	1. Finally configure the time range and refresh rate to be used by Kibana:
		1. Click on the display of the current time window in the upper right corner, i.e. "_Last 15 minutes_"
		2. A setting dialog for the "_Time Range_" is displayed
		3. Click on the "_Auto-refresh_" tab in the top level menu
		4. A setting dialog for the "_Refresh Interval_" is displayed
		5. Change the default value "_Off_" to "_5 seconds_" (eager, we are ;-)
		6. Click on the collapse button "^" in the upper right corner to get rid of the setup dialog

		<img src="/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-5.png" width="600">

## 4.2. Run some tests

Start to make a request using a unique product number, e.g. `123456`:

	$ curl -ks https://localhost/api/product/123456 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .

Search for a business key, i.e. the Product Id `123456` in our case:

![kibana-6](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-6.png)

You will find two log events related to this business key. To find all other log events (from all microservices) related to the processing of this business key pick up the value of the `ml_traceId` (`8dd7ae480348194d` in my case) and make a new search based on that:

![kibana-7](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-7.png)
	
Voila, here are all the log events for the processing of the request!

**Nice, isn't it!**

> **Note:** If you wonder from where the very useful traceId's came, you can take a look into the previous blog post [blog post #7] about [spring-cloud-sleuth]!

## 4.3. Scale test

Remove the search criteria (the trace id) from the search dialog in Kibana.

Next, scale the Recommendation Service to two instances:

	$ docker-compose scale rec=2
	
After a while you should see a log event in Kibana from the `recommendation-service` with a message like:

	Started RecommendationServiceApplication in 13.863 seconds (JVM running for 14.756)

Now, filter log events in Kibana so that you only will see log events from the Recommendation Service. Click on the "_ml___service_" field in the list of selected fields to the left, then click on the magnifying glass with a "+" - sign after the `recommendation-service`. 

<img src="/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-8.png" width="300">

A filter for the recommendation service is now displayed under the search field:

<img src="/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-9.png" width="300">

Now, only events from the "_recommendation-service_" should be visible!

Make a few new calls and see how the value of the "_syslog___hostname_" varies as requests are load balanced over the two instances:

![kibana-10](/assets/blogg/build-microservices-part-8/kibana-10.png)

There is much more to say about the ELK stack but this is as far we get in this blog post. We have, at least, seen how to get started using the ELK stack in a containerized world :-)

# 5. Next up...

Now we have seen how we can use the ELK stack to capture, search and visualize log events. In the [previous blog post][blog post #7] we saw how we could use Zipkin together with Spring Cloud Sleuth to understand the response times in a request that is processed by multiple microservices. One piece of important information is still missing though, i.e. how much hardware resources are utilized by our microservices on an individual level. For example, how much CPU, memory, disk and network capacity is each microservice instance consuming?

This is a question that I will try to answer in the next blog post in the [blog series - Building Microservices](/blogg/teknik/2015/05/20/blog-series-building-microservices), where we will meet [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) with friends, stay tuned :-)
