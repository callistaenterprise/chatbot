tell me o muse of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of troy
many cities did he visit and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted
moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home
but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the sun-god hyperion
so the god prevented them from ever reaching home
tell me too about all these things oh daughter of jove from whatsoever source you may know them
